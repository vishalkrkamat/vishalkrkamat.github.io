My first post. So i build this site using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) and [Anemo theme](https://github.com/Speyll/anemone).

Will write my learnings and thoughts as i go on with my life. It will be mostly tech related stuff.

So what am i learning currently its mostly low level coding using C ans Rust. Lots of things to cover and learn.
