I had no problem with the QWERTY layout — **none**.  
I could touch type without any issue at an average speed of **60–75 WPM** with above **95% accuracy**.

### Why did I switch to a different keyboard layout?

Short answer: **out of curiosity**.  
I heard it’s a lot more efficient than QWERTY. As we all know, QWERTY was never meant for speed or comfort — we just adopted it.

Here’s the [comparison chart](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/compare.html).  
I don’t know how accurate it is.

### My experience

- It took me almost **2 weeks** to get used to it.
- After a month, I can type at roughly **60 WPM with 96%+ accuracy**.
- I’ve noticed way **less finger movement** and a slight increase in accuracy.
- Very comfortable for sure as less finger movement.

It has only been a month, so obviously I’ll get better with time.

`Also worth nothing:` I learned touch typing in QWERTY only about **5–6 month ago**.

### Some minor issue

- Vim bindings i had to remap it according to my comfort
- Struggle using other people computers as they use QWERTY

they will think i dont know how to type well haha!!

### Should anyone switch to a alternate layout

Answer is **NO for 95% of computer users**. Most people don't even know other layout exist and they dont care not that they should.

Switching to a different layout is not really that big of a difference or major typing boost lot of folks dont even know how to touch type
so you know what i mean.

Also most people are so used to typing in Qwerty for years that it becomes really tough to learn a new alternate layout.  
In short for most people its not practical.
